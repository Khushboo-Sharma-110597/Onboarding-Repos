Z technical reading and learning for ${onboardee}

These are in a recommended order of completion, but you don't have to stick to the order. There might be some pieces that are more relevant than others for your role. Go through these with your buddy and/or team lead to see if there are any you should prioritise over others, or ones that aren't required. Edit this issue so that it works for you!
Look for the ⏳ symbol to see how long these tasks tend to take - the categories are minutes, hours, days, weeks, months.
