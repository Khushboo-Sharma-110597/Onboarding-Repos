<summary>Why do we do this?</summary>
  
Booking in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/) ensures that the business knows you are off that day to correctly log your vacation days. Inviting the task ID to a calendar entry ensures that the team can see you are away to avoid booking meetings with you in during your vacation.
