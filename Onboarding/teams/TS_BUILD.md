Build team specific learning for ${onboardee}

### Tools to join:

- [ ] [IBM Z Slack workspace](https://ibm-systems-z.slack.com)
- [ ] [Monday](https://ibm.monday.com/) and request access to [zRE Build Roadmap Planning](https://ibm.monday.com/boards/5873321414)

### Meetings you need to be added to:

- [ ] Daily scrum meeting
- [ ] Weekly planning meeting


### Share your vacation plans:

Book time off in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/).

<details>
<summary>Why do we do this?</summary>
  
Booking in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/) ensures that the business knows you are off that day to correctly log your vacation days. 

Please add a calendar entry in Outlook for your leave and invite zRE Team Calendar <ZRE.Team.Calendar@ibm.com> to it.  Inviting the task ID to a calendar entry ensures that the team can see you are away to avoid booking meetings with you in during your vacation. If you are away for more than two days create an item in the teams work plan (currently Monday).  The item on the Monday board allows sprint planning to take into account your longer periods of vacation.
