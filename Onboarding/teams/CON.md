### Meetings you need to be added to (ask your team lead):

- [ ] Team meeting (weekly)
- [ ] Skillshare 
- [ ] [ID&D calls](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/meeting/10322513)

----

### Share your vacation plans:

- [ ] Ask team lead to give you permissions to view Content Calendar
- [ ] When you've booked time off in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/), please invite CICSContentCalendar@ibm.com to your calendar entry in Outlook.

<details>
<summary>Why do we do this?</summary>
  
Booking in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/) ensures that the business knows you are off that day to correctly log your vacation days. Inviting the task ID to a calendar entry ensures that the team can see you are away to avoid booking meetings with you in during your vacation.
</details>

### Team-specific access, tools, and useful things:

See the [Content Workbook](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki/Required-permissions,-programs-and-sites) for further info on permissions and tools.

- [ ] [Download DCS tools](https://ibmdocs-test.dcs.ibm.com/docs/en/dcs-doc?topic=getting-started-dcs) (Follow all sections, but especially the Onboarding to IBM product docs)
- [ ] [DCS (Digital Content Services)](https://ibmdocs-test.dcs.ibm.com/docs/en/dcs-doc). At its core, DCS is the compiler that transforms our doc source into HTML and PDF ready to be published. "DCS" is often used as short-hand for the compiler plus the build and publishing pipeline that surrounds it.
- [ ] [Workflow Manager (WFM)](https://ibmdocs-test.dcs.ibm.com/docs/en/dcs-doc?topic=dcs-workflow-manager). This is a build and publishing pipeline.
- [ ] [Oxygen XML Author](https://ibmdocs-test.dcs.ibm.com/docs/en/dcs-doc?topic=oxygen-xml-author). This is the authoring tool that we use to work with DITA source. 
- [ ] [Acrolinx](https://ibmdocs-test.dcs.ibm.com/docs/en/dcs-doc?topic=author-acrolinx). This is the checker that we run on DITA topics - it checks for IBM Style and standards. You need to register the first time. 
- [ ] [Google analytics](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/google-analytics/get-access).
- [ ] [Content Workbook wiki](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki). Everyone is encouraged to update so, if you can't find what you're looking for or you can't make sense of what you find, feel free to add/change.
- [ ] [Using GHE](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki/Setting-up-GHE).
- [ ] Ask ${teamlead} to give you access to the Workflow Manager pipelines
- [ ] Ask ${teamlead} to confirm your license, then add you to the Content Team, and the CICS Design Team.

### Initial learning projects around Content processes and tools


##### Writing basics

- [ ] The resources [here](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki/Learn-the-craft:-writing) are good to familiarize you with technical content creation.

----

##### Be aware of our legal requirements

- [ ] Start [here](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki/Keeping-out-of-IBM-content-jail)

----

##### What is DITA?

Read about DITA, why it's valuable in enterprise-scale content and the main components: topics, maps, and output formats.
- [ ] [What is DITA?](https://techwhirl.com/what-is-dita/)
- [ ] [What is DITA & why should you care](https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/524/what-is-dita-and-why-should-you-care) (don't bother with the section "What is the DITA L&TC specialization")

----

##### Developing Quality Technical Information

- [ ] [Your learning course](https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/URL-6DF71F440501?channelId=CNL_LCB_1564087992203)
      The following sections are worth going through (you can skip the rest):
      Task orientation
      Accuracy
      Completeness
      Clarity
      Concreteness
      Style (IBM Style also useful here)
      Organization
      Retrievability

- [ ] [DQTI book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/)

----

##### Using Acrolinx

- [ ] [Set it up](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki/Using-Acrolinx)
- [ ] Work with an experienced content developer to see it in action and how to judge its findings

----

##### Take a look at our product documentation

- [ ] See 'Find product documentation' in the [content workbook](https://github.ibm.com/CICS/content-workbook/wiki) to see the various docs produced by our team
- [ ] Go to the latest release of the docs in IBM Documentation, have a browse
- [ ] Capture your impressions (don't be afraid to be blunt!!)


----

##### How we work as a team, and GHE processes

Ask your team lead or buddy to talk you through these:
- [ ] Aims (how we want to be seen/perform)
- [ ] Areas of interest
- [ ] Who's on which hill/project
- [ ] Skillshares
- [ ] Playbacks
- [ ] Slack channels
- [ ] Team meeting
- [ ] Raising concerns
- [ ] Difference between hill/content team work
- [ ] The GHE workflow (demo)
- [ ] Individual team showcases

----

##### What is Markdown?

- [ ] [What is Markdown and why should you care?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

----

##### Termbot

- [ ] [Look up some terms you've heard in meetings](https://tlwi.w3-969.ibm.com/standards/terminology/Termbot.html)

----

##### Oxygen basics

- [ ] Create and edit some files for practice in Oxygen. There are tutorials [here](https://ibmdocs-test.mybluemix.net/docs/en/dcs-doc?topic=oxygen-xml-author) - but pick and choose. You won't get through all of them.

----

##### Find your way around the doc source

Understand how the source for your product is structured so that you can make sense of the files when you come to work on them. Working with your buddy, for CICS TS, discuss:
- [ ] Folders and their sub-structure
- [ ] Why some files have "normal" names, why some don't
- [ ] Autogenerated content
- [ ] Common content
- [ ] PDFs
- [ ] Keys files

----

##### Build source and seeing output

- [ ] Ask Robert for an overview of how our source gets from GitHub Enterprise (GHE) to something that we can see and share. Workflow Manager (WFM) is the engine in the middle that compiles (builds) the source, stores it in the cloud so that IBM Docs servers can display it.

----

##### Practice making changes to the doc source

- [ ] Get access to the demo area of GHE from Robert

Practice with Oxygen, GHE, Acrolinx and WFM to:
- [ ] Make changes to some source files
- [ ] Check the quality of the doc with Acrolinx
- [ ] Deliver the changes
- [ ] See the delivered changes build
- [ ] Check them in a test server

- [ ] Once you're confident, ask for a work item to be assigned to you so that you can practice this for real.
