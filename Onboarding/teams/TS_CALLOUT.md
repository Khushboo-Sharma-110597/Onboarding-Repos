- [ ] Duty Manager
- [ ] How to return case to L2 including how to set up the notify to L2 and correctly set status change.
- [ ] Make sure skills case is on the right L3 queue

- [ ] Reminder to add OCM callout numbers to phone and potentially add them to your exception lists for callout week on case you have DnD setups on Phones.
- [ ] OCM app - although it really isn't useful at the moment.
- [ ] OCM acknowledge and resolve - closing the callout when we stop work. Can be done via the web, app or in callout slack channel.
