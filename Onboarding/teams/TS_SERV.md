### Share your vacation plans:

When you've booked time off in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/), please invite cicsts_service@uk.ibm.com to your calendar entry in Outlook. 
- [ ] Request read access to the cicsts_service calendar - contact Felicity Merrison (fmerrison@uk.ibm.com)

<details>
<summary>Why do we do this?</summary>
  
Booking in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/) ensures that the business knows you are off that day to correctly log your vacation days. Inviting cicsts_service@uk.ibm.com to a calendar entry ensures that the team can see you are away to avoid booking meetings with you in during your vacation.

To add a shared calendar to Outlook, first go to the Calendar view, right click the "Shared Calendars" twisty and select "Add Shared Calendar". In the "Open Calendar.." pop up, search for "cicsts_service", select "CICS Service" and click Open.
