### Share your vacation plans:

- [ ] When you've booked time off in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/), please invite ETSI-AI@ibm.com to your calendar entry in Outlook.

<details>
<summary>Why do we do this?</summary>
  
Booking in [SuccessFactors](https://sf-wz-prd-p2-4snxii8t.workzonehr.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/) ensures that the business knows you are off that day to correctly log your vacation days. Inviting the task ID to a calendar entry ensures that the team can see you are away to avoid booking meetings with you in during your vacation.
</details>

 
### Giveback:
- [ ] Based on your onboarding experience, make any improvements or updates to the [onboarding template](https://github.ibm.com/etsi/etsi-onboarding/blob/main/tasks/Onboarding/product/AI.md).
