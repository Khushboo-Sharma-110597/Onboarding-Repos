Onboarding for ${onboardee} 

**${onboardee}, welcome to the CICS and Z Integration family!**

- Your buddy mentor is ${buddy}. You can ask them anything!
- Your team mentor is ${teamlead}. They can help you out with accesses, work prioritisation, and more!
- Your manager is ${manager}. They can help you out with anything non-work related, as well as work stuff.

If you haven't seen it already, have a look at the [overview of our onboarding process](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/zsoftwarelearningpath/what-we-build/czi-family/czi-onboarding) to see what is ahead for you.

Please note ${buddy} - ${onboardee} doesn't have access to GHE at first, so please work through the [accesses on this wiki page](https://cicswiki.hursley.ibm.com:9443/wiki/Main_Page) until they can see this!

${manager} if ${onboardee} is to have an office in Hursley, please remember to request their nameplate, key, and any changes to furniture that are required.
